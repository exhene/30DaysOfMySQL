MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is used to manage and store structured data. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the database, which allows users to create, modify, and manage databases and tables, as well as query and manipulate data.

MySQL is widely used by developers and businesses for various purposes, such as building web applications, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms. It is known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use, and it is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. MySQL also supports multiple programming languages, including PHP, Java, and Python, making it a popular choice for developers building applications in those languages.
