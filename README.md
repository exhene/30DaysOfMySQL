SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query databases to retrieve, add, update, or delete data stored in them.

In SQL, you can create tables, which are collections of data organized into rows and columns. You can add data to these tables, modify the data already in them, or delete data that is no longer needed.

SQL also allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables using various commands such as SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY. You can use these commands to filter data based on specific criteria, combine data from multiple tables, perform calculations, and sort the data in a specific order.

SQL is a standard language that is widely used by database administrators, data analysts, and developers across various industries. Its versatility, simplicity, and efficiency make it a popular choice for managing data and performing complex data analysis.
